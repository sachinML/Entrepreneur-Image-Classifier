# Entrepreneur-Image-Classifier
Its a Image classifier Data Science project where I have gone through each life cycle of datascince consedering preprocessing, datacleaning, feature selection, model building.

I have use SVM and Logistic Regression alogorithm to classify the image got to know which will be best for my project.

So after conclusion I got 85% accuracy with the logistic regression which is more compare to SVM.

I have also build the classifiaction report for getting the F1 score, Precision and Recall.



Tools used: Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, Visual Studio Code


Technologies: (1) Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript


              (2) Scikit-learn, Numpy, OpenCV, PyWavlets for feature selection
