# Entrepreneur-Image-Classifier
Its an Image classifier End to End where I have gone through preprocessing, datacleaning, feature selection, model building and web application.

I have used different Machine Learning algorithm to find to which will give the best accuracy and apply that for the Image classification such that it will give the best reult.

Technologies used-

1. Prgramming Language - Python 3.8
2. Machine Learning Library - Scikit learn
3. Image processing Library - OpenCV
4. Web Technology - Flask, HTML5, JavaScript.
