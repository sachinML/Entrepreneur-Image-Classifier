# Entrepreneur-Image-Classifier
![plot](./1.png)
Its an End to End Image classifier project where I have gone through several steps like preprocessing, datacleaning, feature selection, model building and web application.

I have used different Machine Learning algorithms to find out which will give the best accuracy for image classification and use that algorithm to find out the best results.
