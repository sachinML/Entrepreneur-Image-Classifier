# Entrepreneur-Image-Classifier
Its an Image classifier End to End Data Science project where I have gone through each life cycle of datascince considering preprocessing, datacleaning, feature selection, model building and web application.

I have used different Machine Learning algorithm to find to which is giving the best accuracy and apply that for the Imgage classification.

Technologies used-

1. Prgramming Language - Python
2. Machine Learning - Scikit learn for Model Building
3. Image processing - OpenCV for Preprocessing and Feature Selection
4. Web Technology - Flask, HTML5, JavaScript
